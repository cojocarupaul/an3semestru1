# HTML Images

Create a simple yet optimized gallery of images

It should:
* use modern formats (ex: `.webp`) if supported by the browser. Otherwise it should fallback to something everybody understands (ex: `.jpg`)
* **not** load all images at once, but lazy load the ones not currently in view (you'll need many more images for this one)

PS: here's a list of some image URL's in both formats for convenience:

[image_1.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_1.jpg) & [image_1.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_1.webp) <br/>
[image_2.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_2.jpg) & [image_2.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_2.webp)
<br/>
[image_3.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_3.jpg) & [image_3.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_3.webp)
<br/>
[image_4.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_4.jpg) & [image_4.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_4.webp)
<br/>
[image_5.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_5.jpg) & [image_5.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_5.webp)

PS 2: depending on when you're solving this exercise the lazy-load part might not work in every browser. 

PPPS: wondering why `WebP`? Read more about this [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).
