# CSS Modal

Write the markup for an upload modal and style it to look like in the picture below: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/css/modal/modal.png" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

ðŸ’¡ Tip: remember to make it responsive (the modal should always be in the middle of the screen)
