# Unsplash gallery

Write the markup for [Unsplash's](https://unsplash.com) 3'column gallery and style them to behave like theirs do, including the responsive part. Use [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) or [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).

Also. make sure the images themselves are [responsive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) so we don't send more payload than needed.
