# Shopping list

Write a `createShoppingList(homeIngredients, requiredIngredients)` which receives 2 parameters:

* **homeIngredients**: an object describing what ingredients are available at home, including their quantity
* **requiredIngredients**: an object describing what ingredients are needed for the recipe, including their quantity

and **returns a new object** representing all the missing ingredients we need to buy from the store together with their quantities.

```javascript
var  availableAtHome = {
    'Patato': 2,
    'Carot': 3,
    'Spices': 5
}

var  requiredForDinner = {
    'Patato': 3,
    'Carot': 3,
    'Spices': 3,
    'Ice-cream cups': 11,
    'Slices of bread': 2
}

var toBuy = createShoppingList(availableAtHome, requiredForDinner);
console.log(toBuy);

/*
{
    'Patato': 1,
    'Ice-cream cups': 11,
    'Slices of bread': 2
}
*/

function createShoppingList(homeIngredients, requiredIngredients) {
    /** Your code here */
}
```
