# Fibonacci

Write two functions: `fib` and `recursiveFib` which calculate the `n-th` number of the [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in a non-recursieve and recursive manner.

You should call them with one parameter, the index of the number we want to find.

```javascript
fib(6); // 6-th fibonacci number is 8
recursiveFib(6); // 8
```
